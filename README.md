Main files for different simulation settings are in different directories:
- **ryr** : Control (SERCAPumps and RyR)
- **ns** : SERCA Blocked (none)
- **serca** : RyR Blocked (SERCAPumps)
- **ip3** : IP3R SERCA Pumps and IP3R
- **recon-ns** : SERCA Blocked (none) for simulations in reconstruction geometry
- **recon-ryr** : Control (SERCAPumps and RyR) for simulations in reconstruction geometry
- **small-ns** : SERCA Blocked (none) for simulations in small canonical geometry
- **small-ryr** : Control (SERCAPumps and RyR) for simulations in small canonical geometry

Examples main mdl files (the files that needs to be run by MCell) are:
- RS20p20hz.mdl
- RSI20V100.mdl

**I20V80** is short for "**I**nterspike interval of **20** ms and **80** **V**DCC" for a paired pulse stimulus.

**20p20hz** is short for "**20** pulses at **10hz** for a train stimulus.

Run these mdl files through terminal (linux) or command prompt (windows) with following command:
```
mcell RSI20V80.mdl
```

Visit the [MCell Webpage](http://www.mcell.org/) for documentation, installation and tutorial on MCell. Due to major changes in mcell, this model is not compatible with latest version of mcell. Use mcell v3.2.1 instead. The executable mcell file is provided in the repository also.
